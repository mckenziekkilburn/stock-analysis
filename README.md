# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
- Our client Steve is helping his parents figure out which stock to buy. After previously doing work with Steve, he wants to expand his investigation. Steve wants us to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last couple of years. 

### Purpose
- Since we have already came up with VBA code for Steve before, we need to refactor the VBA code so that it will fit to the current needs. 


# Our Final Results
### *For the Year 2017*
##### In the image below, is shown how long it takes for our elapsed run time for all of the stocks for the year 2017.

*To get this window to pop up I had to plug in the following code at the beginning of the Subroutine*

*Furthermore, this code statement had to be added to the bottom of the Subroutine once all of our syntax was corrected and accurate*
